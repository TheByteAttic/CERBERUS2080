These are the design files for CERBERUS's 3 custom chips. The .jed files are the ones you should use to program each of CERBERUS's 3 CPLDs. The .PLD files are the gate-level hardware descriptions for the three CPLDs (these are the files you should modify and re-compile with the CUPL compiler if you want to change the custom ICs). Finally, the .fit files (which show how the compiler has fitted the designs into the available internal resources of the respective CPLDs) are provided just for illustration and reference, as the CUPL compiler automatically generates the .fit and .jed files from the corresponding .PLD files.

<b>CHANGE HISTORY:</b>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>9 September 2021:</b> SCUNK has been upated to Release 1.2. An extra output has been added, which disables the video side of both dual-ported memories (i.e. video and character memories) during the blanking interval. This prevents the memories for issuing a BUSY during the blanking intervals, when the address lines are reset. The update leads to a minor performance improvement, but was motivated by didactical reasons: this is how SCUNK should be designed, as a matter of principle. Owners of Release 1.0 of CERBERUS's board can also use this update, although for them the update will be inert (the respective line is not connected on their version of the PCB).</li>
  <li><b>28 August 2021:</b> Minor update to the SPACER files (Release 1.21): (1) the embedded commentary in the .PLD file was improved for clarity and one minor correction was made; (2) the global, default reset line (RST) was added to the asynchronous reset inputs of the three new internal states created in Release 1.2 (see below), not because it changes anything but just because this is good practice. There are no changes in the functionality. This update is entirely optional and probably only important for OCD types like me.</li>
  <li><b>26 August 2021:</b> SPACER has been updated to eliminate a stability vulnerability associated with the 65C02 CPU (the Z80 remains unaffected). In the previous release (R1.1, of 1 July 2021), if CAT toggled CPUGO at the same time as a clock transition of the 6502's clock, a race condition could arise between RDY6502 and BE6502. This risk is now eliminated in R1.2 (of 26 August 2021). The file SPACER.PLD is extensively commented in the "CPU control logic" section to explain how the update works. Although largely asymptomatic under the original version of CERBERUS's BIOS, the vulnerability would eventually be triggered if there is intense change of control between CAT and the 65C02 under upcoming versions of the BIOS. Therefore,<i> it is recommended that all users and builders of CERBERUS 2080â„¢ adopt R1.2 of SPACER.</i></li>
  <li><b>02 July 2021:</b> The tabulations of all three .PLD files have been re-formatted for better readability. The buried logic nodes are now left unassigned to pins in CAVIA.PLD and SKUNK.PLD as well, not only in SPACER.PLD. This way, the CUPL compiler makes the assignments automatically. The functionality didn't change at all, but the .PLD files are now easier to interpret.</li>
</ul>
