These are the design files for CERBERUS's 3 custom chips. The .jed files are the ones you should use to program each of CERBERUS's 3 CPLDs. The .PLD files are the gate-level hardware description files for the three CPLDs. These are the files you should modify and re-compile with the CUPL compiler if you want to change the custom ICs. Finally, the .fit files (which show how the compiler has fitted the designs into the available CPLD internal resources) are provided just for illustration and reference, as the CUPL compiler automatically generates these files (as well as the .jed files) from the corresponding .PLD files.
