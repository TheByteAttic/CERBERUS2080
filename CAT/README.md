This are files related to CAT, the ATmega328p that serves as CERBERUS 2080™'s I/O processor and system master. 'boards.txt' should be used to change the registery of a standard ATmega328p so to prepare it for use with CERBERUS. The other file is CERBERUS's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) code, which runs on CAT.
