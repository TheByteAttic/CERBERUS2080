This directory contains the source files (.asm), corresponding hexadecimal files (.hex) and final binary files (.bin) of a Cellular Automaton application that runs on both of CERBERUS's CPUs (one version per CPU). They illustrate how to go from assembly code to hex, and then to binary, in a way that CERBERUS 2080™'s loader can deal with.
